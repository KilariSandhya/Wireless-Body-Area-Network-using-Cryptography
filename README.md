# Wireless-Body-Area-Network-using-Cryptography
With recent technical advancement in wireless communication, network security has been of great concern. To address this concern, a secured system is developed to provide data security over wireless transmission. The project presents a wireless body area network with cryptographic AES algorithm which monitors patient biomedical parameters based on sensors, Arduino and ZigBee. In the project, MAx30205 Temperature Sensor and MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter Sensor are considered based on normal issues of people. The project main objective is to provide security to the data obtained from sensor nodes while transmitting encrypted data at client-side and reception of decrypted data at server-side.
